              <h3>Biden’s democracy pledge is in danger</h3>
              <p>
                The organizing principle of Joe Biden’s presidency has been
                standing up for the idea of democracy.
              </p>
              <p>
                His political campaigns are built on defending democracy at
                home, versus would-be election sidestepper Donald Trump.
              </p>
              <p>
                Much of his presidency is built on defending democracy abroad,
                versus Ukraine invader Vladimir Putin, among others.
              </p>
              <p>US democracy is messy</p>
              <p>
                There are cascading frustrations this week – on both the
                domestic and foreign fronts – to test Biden’s promise that
                democracies will win over autocracies.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky failed to change minds
                about further US aid despite paying personal visits to US
                lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Tuesday.
              </p>
              <p>
                Biden himself recently said at a Hanukkah event at the White
                House that Israel’s government, which he described as the “most
                conservative government in Israel’s history,” needs to change
                its severe campaign against Gaza.
              </p>
              <p>
                “The whole world’s public opinion can shift overnight, we can’t
                let that happen,” he said.
              </p>
              <p>
                Biden has previously framed the need to fund Ukraine’s fight
                against Russia and Israel’s fight against terrorism as part of a
                larger struggle in defense of democracies.
              </p>
              <p>
                “Hamas and (Russian President Vladimir) Putin represent
                different threats, but they share this in common: They both want
                to completely annihilate a neighboring democracy – completely
                annihilate it,” Biden said in October, during a prime-time pitch
                for aid for the two countries.
              </p>
              <p>Demands in exchange for Ukraine funding</p>
              <p>
                House Speaker Mike Johnson said in a statement after meeting
                with Zelensky that he supports Ukraine fighting back against
                Putin and promised that Americans “stand for freedom and they’re
                on the right side of this fight.”
              </p>
              <p>
                But Johnson wants some things in exchange for another $61
                billion to keep the fight for freedom supplied, which is making
                the prospect of a deal unlikely before US lawmakers break for
                the holidays. Funding for Israel and border security is also
                caught up in the standoff.
              </p>
              <p>
                Appearing with Zelensky at the White House, Biden said failure
                to immediately pass the funding would be “the greatest Christmas
                gift” for Putin.
              </p>
              <p>
                House Republicans are demanding changes in border policy to
                reduce asylum-seekers and cut down on people crossing the
                border. But that’s not all.
              </p>
              <p>
                “What the Biden administration seems to be asking for is
                billions of additional dollars with no appropriate oversight, no
                clear strategy to win, and none of the answers that I think the
                American people are owed,” Johnson said.

              <h3>
                Impeachment inquiry threatens Biden with election-year headache
              </h3>
              <p>
                By voting to formally authorise the congressional investigation
                into Joe Biden, Republicans in the House of Representatives have
                started the ball rolling towards his impeachment.
              </p>
              <p>It may be difficult to stop.</p>
              <p>
                Three of the four previous times the House took this step, the
                chamber ultimately opted to impeach. The one time it did not was
                because Richard Nixon resigned before a vote could be held.
              </p>
              <p>
                Republicans allege the president benefited from his family's
                foreign business dealings, although they have not yet produced
                any solid evidence that he did.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the short-term, the House's action gives the investigating
                committees more power to subpoena documents and testimony and
                for judges to enforce those requests. The Biden White House,
                which has cited the lack of a formal vote as grounds for
                refusing to provide some information, may now be compelled to
                comply.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ultimately, this vote could clear the path for House
                Republicans, despite their narrow majority, to stick together
                and back impeachment sometime in early 2024.
              </p>
              <p>
                They now are on the record agreeing to move the process forward.
                If centrist Republicans in congressional districts won by Mr
                Biden in 2020 are going to take the political hit for starting
                the investigation, they may conclude it is best to see it
                through to the end.
              </p>
              <p>
                The end in the House, at least. The matter would then move to
                the Democratic-controlled Senate, where it takes a two-thirds
                majority to convict and remove a president.
              </p>
              <p>
                That is a high bar that has never been reached for a president
                in US history. And at least some Republicans have expressed
                concern that Wednesday's vote could be another indication that
                the impeachment process is being diminished.
              </p>
              <p>
                Asa Hutchinson, a former congressman and current Republican
                presidential candidate, was one of the House managers who
                presented the case against Mr Clinton during his 1999 Senate
                impeachment trial.
              </p>
              <p>
                "Impeachment should be reserved for the most serious of
                offences," he told the BBC. "That's how our founding fathers
                designed it. We don't want to get into the tit-for-tat between
                the parties on impeaching the president from the opposing side.
                It's problematic."

              <h3>
                Mideast crisis will test whether Biden can make experience an
                asset
              </h3>
              <p>
                The escalating confrontation between Israel and Hamas is
                offering President Joe Biden a crucial opportunity to begin
                flipping the script on one of his most glaring vulnerabilities
                in the 2024 presidential race.
              </p>
              <p>
                For months, polls have consistently shown that most Americans
                believe Biden’s advanced age has diminished his capacity to
                handle the responsibilities of the presidency. But many
                Democrats believe that Biden’s widely praised response to the
                Mideast crisis could provide him a pivot point to argue that his
                age is an asset because it has equipped him with the experience
                to navigate such a complex challenge.
              </p>
              <p>
                “As you project forward, we are going to be able to argue that
                Joe Biden’s age has been central to his success because in a
                time of Covid, insurrection, Russian invasion of Ukraine, now
                challenges in the Middle East, we have the most experienced man
                ever as president,” said Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg.
                “Perhaps having the most experienced person ever to go into the
                Oval Office was a blessing for the country. I think we are going
                to be able to make that argument forcefully.”
              </p>
              <p>
                Biden unquestionably faces a steep climb to ameliorate the
                concern that he’s too old for the job. Political strategists in
                both parties agree that those public perceptions are largely
                rooted in reactions to his physical appearance – particularly
                the stiffness of his walk and softness of his voice – and thus
                may be difficult to reverse with arguments about his
                performance. In a CNN poll released last month, about
                three-fourths of adults said Biden did not have “the stamina and
                sharpness to serve effectively as president” and nearly as many
                said he does not inspire confidence. Even about half of
                Democrats said Biden lacked enough stamina and sharpness and did
                not inspire confidence, with a preponderant majority of
                Democrats younger than 45 expressing those critical views.
              </p>
              <p>
                But the crisis in Israel shows the path Biden will probably need
                to follow if there’s any chance for him to transmute doubts
                about his age into confidence in his experience. Though critics
                on the left and right in American politics have raised
                objections, Biden’s response to the Hamas attack has drawn
                praise as both resolute and measured from a broad range of

                Putin warns of problems with neighboring Finland after West
                ‘dragged it into NATO’
              </h3>
              <p>
                Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned there will be
                “problems” with neighboring Finland after it joined the North
                Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) earlier this year.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finland’s ascension to NATO marked a major shift in the security
                landscape in northern Europe, and added some 1,300 kilometers
                (830 miles) to the alliance’s frontier with Russia
              </p>
              <p>
                It was also a blow for President Putin, who has long warned
                against NATO expansion.
              </p>
              <p>
                “They (the West) took Finland and dragged it into NATO! Why, did
                we have any disputes with Finland? All disputes, including those
                of a territorial nature in the middle of the 20th Century, have
                all been resolved long ago,” Putin said in an interview
                published on Sunday.
              </p>
              <p>
                “There were no problems, but now there will be, because we will
                now create the Leningrad military district there and definitely
                concentrate military units there,” Putin added in the interview
                by Russian state broadcaster Russia 1.
              </p>

              <p>
                Putin also dismissed as “complete nonsense” remarks from US
                President Joe Biden, who earlier this month warned that Putin
                would “keep going” if he takes Ukraine, suggesting that Russia
                could eventually attack a NATO ally and draw US troops into
                conflict.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Russian leader said Russia “has no reason, no interest, no
                geopolitical interest, neither economic, nor political, nor
                military, to fight with NATO countries,” adding Moscow does not
                have any territorial claims in NATO countries.
              </p>
              <p>
                “There is no desire to spoil relations with them (NATO
                countries), we are interested in developing relations,” Putin
                added.

                Opinion | The Most Powerful Anti-Trump Argument in the GOP Has
                Evaporated
              </h3>
              <p>
                Joe Biden has done Donald Trump the enormous favor of collapsing
                before our eyes.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the 2024 GOP presidential race heads into the first contests,
                Biden’s abysmal run of polling has boosted Trump and undercut
                his Republican opponents by hanging a neon sign on our politics
                reading, “TRUMP CAN WIN
              </p>
              <p>
                It may be that Trump, such is his hold on GOP voters, didn’t
                need any help establishing a dominant position in the fight for
                the Republican nomination, but two exogenous events have boosted
                him.
              </p>

              <p>
                First, the indictments from the Justice Department and
                Democratic prosecutors created a predictable rally-around-Trump
                effect that put him on a fundamentally higher trajectory in the
                race, and second, Biden’s execrable polling has completely
                eliminated any possibility of making an electability argument
                against Trump.
              </p>
              <p>
                There’s picking your opponent through underhanded ads —
                something Democrats did to help get vulnerable MAGA opponents in
                2022 — and then there’s picking your opponent through your own
                incredible weakness that makes him look even more alluring to
                his partisans.
              </p>
              <p>
                The most salient doubt about Trump among on-the-fence
                Republicans has never been his policy priorities, governing
                effectiveness or conduct after the 2020 election, but his
                ability to win.
              </p>
              <p>
                Trump’s standing in the party was shaken after the 2022
                elections when Republicans underperformed, and he had his
                fingerprints on the disappointment. The Ron DeSantis landslide
                in Florida created a contrast that seemingly opened a vista for
                an intuitive, winning argument — stick with Trump and lose, or
                go with the young, fresh governor and win.
              </p>
              <p>
                The electability argument also had the advantage of
                side-stepping any of the issues about Trump that most
                Republicans don’t want to hear. Saying he can’t win isn’t a
                critique of him personally or anything he wants to do. It’s a
                practical claim, not a moral one. And it can be offered more in
                a tone of sorrow than anger.
              </p>
              <p>
                The problem is that the polling hasn’t cooperated, thanks to
                Biden’s downward spiral.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2016, Trump was often reduced to citing Drudge polls and
                other dubious sources to try to demonstrate what he’s always
                maintained is his overwhelming public support. This time around,
                he can cite the most reputable polls in the business.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Biden collapse is nearly comprehensive. He is losing in
                ballot tests to Trump, his approval rating is scraping bottom,
                he’s trailing on almost every top issue, and super-majorities
                think he’s too old to serve again.
              </p>
              <p>
                He is the weakest incumbent since Jimmy Carter or George H.W.
                Bush.
              </p>
              <p>
                The latest Wall Street Journal poll has Trump leading Biden by 4
                points in a hypothetical two-way race, and 6 in a
                multi-candidate field. Only 37 percent approve of Biden’s job
                performance, while 61 percent disapprove. Fewer than 30 percent
                of voters approve of “Bidenomics.”
              </p>
              <p>
                Trump leads by double digits on the economy, inflation, crime,
                the Ukraine and Gaza wars, and the border. He leads by 34 points
                on having the physical stamina to do the job, and 16 points on
                being mentally up for the job. And people think Trump policies
                helped them by 49-37 percent, and Biden hurt them by 25-53.
              </p>
              <p>
                Is this just early, showy, unsustainable Trump support? Maybe.
                But Trump never led in 2020 polling
              </p>
              <p>
                As if to provide a punctuation mark on the Wall Street Journal
                poll, CNN came out with a survey that showed Trump leading by 5
                points in Georgia and a jaw-dropping 10 points in Michigan.
              </p>
              <p>
                Republican voters already had an exaggerated sense of Trump’s
                electoral prowess, but many of them are probably ready to
                conclude they could run Perry Johnson or Ryan Binkley next year
                and win. Why worry — about what might happen to Trump next year
                at trial, or his underwhelming electoral history, or the effects
                he has in the suburbs — when 2024 is a lock?
              </p>
              <p>
                Republican voters have long considered Trump the strongest
                general election candidate. Still, he’s been gaining on this
                metric. A recent Monmouth poll found that 54 percent of
                Republicans think Trump would be the strongest candidate, up
                from 48 percent in September and 45 percent in July. Even 41
                percent of Republicans supporting other candidates think Trump
                would be strongest.

                White House and Senate negotiators race to reach a border deal,
                with Ukraine aid on the line
              </h3>
              <p>
                Democrats and Republicans will not be able to strike a deal on
                US southern border policy changes this year, GOP Sen. Lindsey
                Graham said Sunday, following weeks of negotiations over tying
                tighter immigration restrictions to supplemental funding for
                Ukraine and Israel.
              </p>
              <p>
                Republicans, Graham said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet the
                Press,” “feel that we’re being jammed. We’re not anywhere close
                to a deal. It’ll go into next year.”
              </p>
              <p>
                Democrats and Republicans are urgently trying to reach an
                agreement on border policy changes before senators leave town
                for the holidays, but several congressional aides are skeptical
                a deal can be reached as sizable differences remain.
              </p>
              <p>
                President Joe Biden has repeatedly called on Congress to pass
                his national security supplemental funding request, which
                includes billions for Ukraine, Israel and border security, among
                other priorities. He’s warned that the funds are imperative for
                Ukraine, which the US has pledged to support in defending
                against Russia, and more broadly, for US national security.
              </p>
              <p>
                For weeks, negotiators on both sides of the aisles have wrestled
                over tying tighter immigration restrictions to supplemental
                funding for Ukraine and Israel. Republicans insist there needs
                to be a change on the US southern border, where migrant surges
                have strained federal resources, to move forward with funding
                for Ukraine.
              </p>
              <p>
                “This is a catastrophe, and it’s a result of the Biden open
                border policies,” Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said on “Fox News
                Sunday.” “We’re going to use this opportunity to change that.”
              </p>
              <p>
                In a sign of the challenges negotiators face in trying to get an
                immigration deal that can pass the Senate this week, 15 GOP
                senators, including Graham, are demanding a special conference
                meeting in January to discuss the negotiations. In a letter sent
                Sunday to Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, chair of the Senate
                Republican Conference, the senators criticized the “rushed and
                secret” talks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, the top Republican at the
                negotiation table for border talks, said he thinks meeting to
                discuss the legislation when the House returns the week of
                January 8 is a “realistic timeline.”
              </p>
              <p>
                Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has insisted the chamber
                will hold a vote on the legislation this week – but Lankford
                noted senators still do not have legislative text.
              </p>
              <p>
                “That’s up to Leader Schumer, but we don’t have text. So,
                there’s no text to be able to have a vote on,” he said, adding
                that senators will meet again Monday.
